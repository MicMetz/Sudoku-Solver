		 * Checks to see if the current board is valid. A valid board is one where
		 * there are no duplicate values in:
		 *   -Any row
		 *   -Any column
		 *   -Any of the 3x3 subgrids (boxes)
		 * This method should return true if the board is valid (no duplicates)
		 * and false otherwise. To solve this, create and implement
		 * 4 helper methods:
		 * 	 -checkRow - checks a single row for duplicates
		 *   -checkColumn - checks a single column for duplicates
		 *   -checkBoxes - divides the grid into 9 3x3 boxes and calls
		 *   			   checkBox for each box
		 *   -checkBox - checks a single 3x3 box for duplicates
		 *   
		 * Using these methods, your pseudocode for checkBoard is as follows:
		 * 	 for (each row in board):
		 * 		if (row contains duplicate): return false
		 *   endfor
		 *   for (each column in board):
		 *      if (column contains duplicate) return false

		/**
		 * Attempts to recursively solve a sudoku board using a backtracking approach.
		 * The algorithm works as follows:
		 *   1. Base case 1: if the board is invalid (contains duplicates in
		 *      any row, column, or box) return false.
		 *      
		 *   2. Base case 2: if the board is full, this means we've solved
		 *      it, so return true 
		 *      
		 *   3. Otherwise, iterate through every cell (i.e., every row and column
		 *      in the board) looking an empty cell (indicated by the
		 *      cell value being 0). 
		 *      
		 *      3.A) If the cell is empty, iteratively try all possible values 
		 *           1-9 in the cell, calling solve again each time you try a 
		 *           potential value. If this call to solve returned true,
		 *           our attempted value solved the board, so call 
		 *           GUISudoku.updateSudokuGUI(board); to update the GUI to 
		 *           show the solution and return true (if you are ready to
		 *           move on to the GUI part. If not, just return true for
		 *           now).
		 *           
		 *      3.B) If we've tried all numbers 1-9 for the cell and none of the
		 *           calls to solve returned true, then the board is not solvable
		 *           so return false.
		 *           
		 *   4. If we've finished iterating through every cell and haven't already
		 *      returned, we must have solved the board, so return true.
		 * 
		 * Putting this idea into pseudocode results in:
		 * 
		 * 1. if (board is invalid): return false;
		 * 2. if (board is full): return true;
		 * 
		 * 3. for each row in board:
		 * 		for each column in board:
		 * 3.A)		if (board[row][column] is empty):
		 * 				for each potential sudoku value 1-9:
		 * 					set board[row][column] = potential sudoku value
		 * 					if (solve(board)): 
		 * 						 GUISudoku.updateSudokuGUI(board); // Updates the GUI to show the solution
		 * 						 return true;
		 * 					endif
		 * 				endfor
		 * 
		 * 3.B)			//if we've reached here, the board isn't solveable
		 * 				set board[row][column] = 0
		 * 				return false 
		 * 			endif
		 * 		endfor
		 * 	  endfor
		 * 4. return true;
		 * 
		 * You can use the checkBoard method to see if the board is valid (base
		 * case 1). Create a helper method to determine if the board is
		 * full or not (base case 2). I've created a GUISudoku.updateSudokuGUI(board); 
		 * method for you so that you can display the solved board in the GUI, 
		 * the pseudocode above shows where to put this call.
		 * 
		 * Note: this approach may be extremely slow for complex boards with many
		 * empty cells. 
		 * 
		 * @param board A 2D array of ints corresponding to a sudoku board where
		 * 		  		0's indicate an empty cell
		 * @return true if the method successfully solves the board, false otherwise
